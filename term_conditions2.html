        <p>We will place you in a ML job within 6 months of submitting the course assignments or we will refund the course fee.</p>

        <h2>How is the Job Guarantee possible?</h2>
        <p>There are thousands of open positions for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science roles across various industries which need to be filled in the next few years.</p>
        <p>The demand for Machine Learning and data science engineers is growing and employers care about practical and applicable skills. Our course is structured around real-world projects so that you end up with a strong portfolio to showcase your practical knowledge.</p>
        <p>We are very confident of the relevance, breadth, and depth of our course content. We strongly believe that our course could help you land in most ML roles. We know our course is good and hence we back it with a job-guarantee.</p>
